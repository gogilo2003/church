# TODO

* Allowing for listing of multiple contributions for a member, especially for recurrent contributions
* Allow for payment for individual contribution multiple times in any selected amount less than or equal to the expected balance.
* The end_at field in the contributions table is to be used to track multiple contributions for recurrent contribution types, this helps in automating subsequent enrollment for recurrent payments.
